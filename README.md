# Django Custom Group Model

## Overview

Django Custom Group Model is a package that allows you to replace the default Django Group model with a custom one with full compatibility with the Django permissions framework.

Here are some reasons why you may want to use this package:

- Add more fields to the Django Group model

- Override existing Django Group model fields

- Rename the Group model to something else

- When starting a project, setting a custom Group model will allow you to customize it in the future when the need arises.

## Requirements

- Python: 3.6+

- Django: 5.0, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0

## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install django-group-model
```

Add `'django_group_model'`  to your `INSTALLED_APPS`. Make sure to place it before any apps that define the `Group` or `User` models.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_group_model',
]
```

## Usage

### Overriding the default Group model

`django-group-model` allows overriding the `Group` model by setting the `AUTH_GROUP_MODEL` setting to a value that references a custom model.

```python
AUTH_GROUP_MODEL = 'myapp.Group'
```

The below model is identical to the default `Group` model from `django.contrib.auth.models`, but allows customizing in the future.

```python
from django_group_model.models import AbstractGroup


class Group(AbstractGroup):
    # You can add custom fields here
    pass
```

Here, the name of the class being `Group` is important. See below on how to customize the name of the model. In order to use this, set the `AUTH_GROUP_MODEL` setting in your `settings.py` to point to your custom `Group` model.

In your custom `User` model (see [Customizing authentication in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/customizing/#substituting-a-custom-user-model)), set a field to point to your custom `Group` model

```python
...

class User(AbstractUser, ...):
    ...
    groups = models.ManyToManyField(
        'myapp.Group',
        verbose_name=_("groups"),
        blank=True,
        help_text=_(
            "The groups this user belongs to. A user will get all permissions "
            "granted to each of their groups."
        ),
        related_name="user_set",
        related_query_name="user",

    )
    ...
```

Once again, the name of the field is important. See below on how to customize the name of the model. Also take note of the `related_name` and `related_query_name`. Most of the time, the pattern shown above should work. For a deeper understanding see [Django docs here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name).

### Customizing the name of the Group model

Overriding the default `Group` model with a custom name involves 2 steps:

1. Create a model class that extends `AbstractGroup` with any name that you like.

2. Override `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` attributes of the `Meta` class. 

Let's go through this with an example. We'll override the default `Group` model with a model called `Role` in this example. But you could call it whatever you like.

First we will create a `Role` model that extends `AbstractUser`

```python
from django_group_model.models import AbstractGroup


class Role(AbstractGroup):
    # You can add custom fields here

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = "role"
        verbose_name_plual = "roles"
```

Next, we'll use it in our user class.

```python
...

class User(AbstractUser, ...):
    ...
    roles = models.ManyToManyField(
        'myapp.Role',
        blank=True,
        related_name="user_set",
        related_query_name="user",
    )
    groups = None
    ...
```

**IMPORTANT: The name of the field must be the name of your <nobr>custom model in lowercase + 's'.</nobr>** So, the `Role` model becomes `roles`. This is a limitation at this point. Feel free to open an issue and a pull request with ideas to resolve this (see the contributing section below).

**Note:** Here we are setting the `groups` to `None` which is important to remove the default linking to the default group model in order to avoid conflicts.

Also, take note of the `related_name` and `related_query_name`. Most of the time, the pattern shown above should work. For a deeper understanding see [Django docs here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name).

Don't forget to set this model as the `AUTH_GROUP_MODEL` in `settings.py`.

## AbstractGroup

The `AbstractGroup` class implements the same attributes as Django's default `Group` model.

- **name**
  A unique `CharField` with a `max_length` of 150.
  If you would like to override this field, and **you want to call it something else**, you must also override the `__str__` and `natural_key` methods to return the new field.
  
  **Example:**
  
  ```python
  class Role(AbstractGroup):
      name = None
      new_name = models.CharField(max_length=150, unique=True)
      # Your other fields
  
      def __str__(self):
          return self.new_name
  
      def natural_key(self):
          return (self.new_name,)
  
      class Meta:
          verbose_name = "role"
          verbose_name_plual = "roles"
  ```

- **permissions**
  A `ManyToManyField` to Django's `Permission` model.
  You don't want to override this unless you have a very good reason.
